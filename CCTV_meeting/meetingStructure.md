## Meeting Structure:

- First 10 mins: Build rapport, understand his business
- Next 15 mins: Ask questions, take notes, listen more than you talk
- Last 10 mins: If there's a clear problem - propose solution. If not - be honest: "I don't - think you need a website right now because..."


Before we talk about a website, I want to understand your business properly. I don't want to build something useless. Can I ask you about how you handle customers day-to-day?"

 ` -  "I'm here to understand, not to sell"`
 ` - Treat me like I'm studying your business`
 ` - No question is stupid if it helps me help you`

✅ Manual work that can be automated
✅ Repeated questions that can be answered once
✅ Lost customers due to slow response/poor info
✅ Time wasted on admin tasks
✅ Missed opportunities because he's too busy
✅ Information chaos (details scattered everywhere)
